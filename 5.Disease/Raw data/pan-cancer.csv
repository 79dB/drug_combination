ANGPT1,Angiogenesis,"ANGPT1 functions as a TIE2 agonist, which induces receptor phosphorylation and activates downstream signalling pathways. ANGPT1-induced TIE2 activation results in endothelial cell survival signals and the maintenance of the endothelial barrier and quiescent vasculature.",20651738
ANGPT2,Angiogenesis,"ANGPT2 normally functions as an ANGPT1antagonist and increases vascular permeability, destabilizes quiescent vasculature and primes the endothelial bed for angiogenesis. When functioning as an ANGPT1n antagonist, ANGPT2 promotes the dissociation of pericytes from pre-existing vessels and increases vascular permeability, which facilitates the infiltration of proteases, cytokines and angiogenic myeloid cells — which prime the vasculature for a robust angiogenic response in the presence of growth factors such as VEGFA.",20651738
CDH5,Angiogenesis,"Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is specifically expressed in the endothelium. Previous work showed that VE-cadherin associates to VEGF-R2 and modulate its signaling pathways.

CXCL5,Angiogenesis,"CXCL5, a member of the CXC chemokine family, has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Overexpression of CXCL5 is associated with poor survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of CXCL5 is significantly correlated with poorer tumor differentiation, advanced clinical stage, and shorter patient survival.",21356384
CXCL8,Angiogenesis,"IL8 is a proinflammatory CXC chemokine associated with the promotion of neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation. As a consequence of the diversity of effectors and downstream targets, IL-8 signaling promotes angiogenic responses in endothelial cells, increases proliferation and survival of endothelial and cancer cells, and potentiates the migration of cancer cells, endothelial cells, and infiltrating neutrophils at the tumor site. IL-8 signaling has been implicated in regulating the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor, underpinning the transition to an androgen-independent proliferation of prostate cancer cells. In addition, stress and drug-induced IL-8 signaling has been shown to confer chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer cells.",18980965

PDGFC,Angiogenesis,"An increasing number of studies indicate a multi-faceted role for PDGFC: it is involved in angiogenesis, fibroblast recruitment and the stimulation of tumour growth through an autocrine mechanism. A recent study also reports that, similar to other PDGF family members, PDGFC might recruit pericytes, resulting in the formation of more mature, stabilized blood vessels that are refractory to anti-VEGF treatment.",20574450
PGF,Angiogenesis,"PIGF expression, unlike that of VEGF, is undetectable in most organs in healthy conditions, but is highly upregulated in tumor conditions, contributing to the angiogenic and inflammatory switch. In tumors, PlGF is not only produced by malignant cells, but also by endothelial cells, smooth-muscle cells, pericytes, cancer-associated fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages, and various other inflammatory cells in tumor stroma. PlGF induces various biological effects by affecting a wide range of different cell types. PlGF can stimulate vessel growth and maturation directly by affecting endothelial and mural cells, and indirectly by recruiting pro-angiogenic cell types. For example, PlGF stimulates the growth, migration and survival of endothelial cells, increases the proliferations of fibroblasts and smooth-muscle cells, induces vasodilatation, and stimulates collateral vessel growth. It also promotes the recruitment and maturation of angiogenesis-competent myeloid progenitors to growing sprouts and collateral vessels. In addition, PlGF activates and attracts macrophages that release angiogenic and lymphangiogenic molecules, and inhibits the differentiation of dendritic cells.",22217448
TEK,Angiogenesis,"ANGPT1 functions as a TIE2 receptor agonist, and ANGPT2 normally functions as an ANGPT1 antagonist. TIE2 is predominantly expressed on endothelial cells and binds all the known ANGPT ligands.",20651738

VEGFB,Angiogenesis,"This growth factor is able to directly stimulate endothelial-cell growth and migration by increasing the secretion of proteinases in vitro and to promote capillary tube formation in Matrigel in vivo. In many cases, VEGFB levels are increased in malignant tissues, such as in ovarian, colorectal, renal cell and prostate cancer.",19029957
VEGFC,Angiogenesis,VEGF-C and VEGF-D are able to activate both KDR and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) and have a dual role as an angiogenic and lymphangiogenic growth factor.,19701853
VWF,Angiogenesis,"VWF αvβ3, which is expressed on EC and is the best characterised endothelial receptor for VWF, has been shown to play a crucial role in angiogenesis and is a therapeutic target for cancer. VWF is produced by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. In recent years, it has become evident that VWF plays multiple roles in the vasculature. VWF has been shown to control smooth muscle cell proliferation, vascular inflammation, cell death and tumour metastasis. VWF was found to regulate two pathways, possibly linked, which may be controlling angiogenesis: an extracellular pathway involving integrin αvβ3 and an intracellular pathway involving Ang-2 storage in WPB. Besides Ang-2, VWF interacts with or regulates the storage of several proteins which have been implicated in the control of angiogenesis, including interleukin-8, galectin-1 and galectin-3, connective tissue growth factor59 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7. These studies suggest that VWF controls stability and quiescence through an intracellular pathway, by directing the formation of WPB and hence the storage of Ang-2 (and possibly other angiogenic regulators), and extracellular pathway, by stabilizing αvβ3 on the cell surface and regulating its levels and activity.",24106610

IL21,Antitumor cytokines,"IL-21 is produced by a variety of activated CD4+ T cells including TH1 and TH17 cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells and follicular helper T cells. IL-21 exerts potent antitumor effects due to its ability to induce and expand cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NK cells and NKT cells, as well as to its capacity to suppress FOXP3 expression and the expansion of regulatory T cells",23894713
TNF,Antitumor cytokines,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), isolated 30 years ago, is a multifunctional cytokine playing a key role in apoptosis and cell survival as well as in inflammation and immunity. If expressed chronically, contributes to the chronic inflammation (promotes TGF-beta expression, Treg expansion, EMT).",16614236
TNFSF10,Antitumor cytokines,"TRAIL, a member of the TNF family, induces apoptosis in a variety of transformed cells following ligation to TRAIL-Receptor-1/DR4 and -2/DR5.

CD22,B cells,"CD22 is expressed in mature B cells, but not in their precursor or memory B cells. It is strongly expressed in follicular, mantle and marginal-zone B cells, but is weakly present in germinal B cells, thus indicting its potential therapeutic target for B-NHL. The function of CD22 has not been entirely clarified; it acts as a homing receptor for recirculating B cells through the affinity of the lectin-like domains for 2,6-linked sialic acid-bearing glycans and as a B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) down-modulating co-receptor.",22453099
CD79A,B cells,"Among the different B-cell markers, CD79a has the highest linage-specificity for B-cell differentiation, with a specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 100%.

CR2,B cells,"The complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) binds to fragments of complement C3 (C3d, C3dg and iC3b), and together with CD19 and CD81 forms a co‐receptor to the B cell receptor (BCR). The binding of complement‐tagged antigens to the BCR and CD21 results in co‐ligation, which amplifies signals transduced through the BCR and thus lowers the B cell activation threshold.",27010233

STAP1,B cells,"STAP1 is a relatively unknown protein, consisting out of Peckstrin homology (PH) domains and unique Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, suggesting that STAP1 recruits signaling proteins to receptor tyrosine kinases. STAP1 is reported to be a docking protein downstream of Tec protein tyrosine kinase (TEC), which is involved in BCR signaling. In addition, reports show enriched expression in hematopoietic stem cells and a potential role of STAP1 in microglia activation has been suggested.",29330417
TNFRSF13B,B cells,"BAFF can bind to three receptors, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and BAFF-receptor (BAFF-R) (also known as BR3).

By TMA-IHC analysis, we further revealed that COL6A3 protein was significantly upregulated in the stromal cells of CRC tissues comparing with the normal counterparts. Interestingly, the upregulation of COL6A3 in cancer stroma predicted poor outcome of CRC patients, as revealed by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.",26338966
CXCL12,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,"CXCL12, also known as SDF1a, binds to its cognate receptor, CXCR4. Previous studies showed that CAFs secrete CXCL12, stimulate CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling and promote tumor growth and angiogenesis in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.",26414794
FAP,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,FAP is a membrane-bound serine protease of the prolyl oligopeptidase family with unique post-prolyl endopeptidase activity.

PDGFRB,Cancer-associated fibroblasts,"Platelet-derived growth factor is a major mitogen for several cell types, including connective tissue cells, that is activated by binding to two protein tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ). The results from our study revealed that higher grade PT with more active fibroblasts showed higher expression of PDGFRα and β, suggesting that fibroblasts with a CAF phenotype are associated with PT progression.",27881889
BTLA,Checkpoint molecules,"BTLA was first identified as an inhibitory receptor on T cells. Subsequently, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM; also known as TNFRSF14) — which is expressed on certain tumour cell types (for example, melanoma) as well as on tumour-associated endothelial cells — was shown to be the BTLA ligand. BTLA may also be a relevant inhibitory receptor for T cells in the tumour microenvironment. Dual blockade of BTLA and PD1 clearly enhances antitumour immunity.",22437870
CD274,Checkpoint molecules,"Interaction between the Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of tumor cells with the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor on cytotoxic T lymphocytes leads to inactivation of these immune effectors and, consequently, immune escape. Here we show that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis also leads to tumor cell resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.",26859684
CTLA4,Checkpoint molecules,"CTLA4, the first immunecheckpoint receptor to be clinically targeted, is expressed exclusively on T cells where it primarily regulates the amplitude of the early stages of T cell activation. Primarily, CTLA4 counteracts the activity of the T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD28. CD28 does not affect T cell activation unless the TCR is first engaged by cognate antigen. Once antigen recognition occurs, CD28 signalling strongly amplifies TCR signalling to activate T cells. CD28 and CTLA4 share identical ligands: CD80 (also known as B7.1) and CD86 (also known as B7.2). Although the exact mechanisms of CTLA4 action are under considerable debate, because CTLA4 has a much higher overall affinity for both ligands, it has been proposed that its expression on the surface of T cells dampens the activation of T cells by outcompeting CD28 in binding CD80 and CD86, as well as actively delivering inhibitory signals to the T cells.",22437870
HAVCR2,Checkpoint molecules,"TIM3, the ligand of which is galectin 9 (a galectin that is upregulated in various types of cancer, including breast cancers) inhibits T helper 1 (TH1) cell responses. TIM3 has also been reported to be co-expressed with PD1 on tumour-specific CD8+ T cells, and dual blockade of both molecules significantly enhances the in vitro proliferation and cytokine production of human T cells when stimulated by the cancer–testes antigen, NY-ESO-1. In animal models, coordinate blockade of PD1 and TIM3 was reported to enhance antitumour immune responses and tumour rejection in circumstances in which only modest effects from blockade of each individual molecule were observed.",22437870
LAG3,Checkpoint molecules,"LAG-3 (CD223) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on a variety of cell types including T cells, NK cells, B cells and dendritic cells. LAG-3 is generally absent on resting T cells and is upregulated on activated T cells. By interacting with its ligand, MHC class II, LAG-3 plays a negative regulatory role and suppresses T cell function.",28977875
PDCD1,Checkpoint molecules,"The major role of PD1 is to limit the activity of T cells in peripheral tissues at the time of an inflammatory response to infection and to limit autoimmunity. When engaged by one of its ligands, PD1 inhibits kinases that are involved in T cell activation through the phosphatase SHP250, although additional signalling pathways are also probably induced. Also, because PD1 engagement inhibits the TCR ‘stop signal’, this pathway could modify the duration of T cell–APC or T cell–target cell contact.",22437870
PDCD1LG2,Checkpoint molecules,"PD1 only inhibits lymphocyte function when it is engaged by its ligands, PDL1 and PDL2. PDL2 has also been reported to be upregulated in various tumours.",22437870

Taken together, our data suggest TIGIT as a promising new target for immune checkpoint blockade in FL.",29217528
VSIR,Checkpoint molecules,The frequent observation of increased expression of intratumoral VISTA+ lymphocytes during acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy suggests that this is probably an important mechanism of resistance.,28776578
CD40LG,Co-stimulatory ligands,"In normal tissues, signaling through CD40 has been implicated in enhanced antigen presentation function and cytokine release. CD40 ligand (CD40L), also known as CD154, functions as the natural ligand for CD40. It is expressed primarily on the surface of activated T lymphocytes but has also been found on activated platelets. CD40L is a major component of T-cell help for B cells in antibody isotype switching and in the formation of memory B cells and germinal centers.",11432896
CD70,Co-stimulatory ligands,"CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, acts as a potent costimulatory molecule that, unlike other related family members, is expressed constitutively on unstimulated T lymphocytes. CD70, the ligand for CD27, is transiently expressed on antigen-presenting cells. CD27-CD70 mediated costimulation — concomitant with antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation — results in T-cell activation, proliferation, survival, and maturation of effector capacity and T-cell memory. CD27-CD70 interactions also promote B-cell proliferation, generation of plasma cells, production of immunoglobulin and B-cell memory, and induction of the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells.",28463630
CD80,Co-stimulatory ligands,"The B7-related molecules CD80 and CD86 are expressed on antigen-presenting cells, bind the homologous T cell receptors CD28 and CTLA-4, and trigger costimulatory signals important for optimal T cell activation.

CD83,Co-stimulatory ligands,"Human CD83 is a marker molecule for mature dendritic cells (DC) and is also expressed on activated B and T cells.

ICOSLG,Co-stimulatory ligands,"ICOS binds to the related molecule B7H (also known as B7RP1, LICOS or GL50). Ligation of ICOS by B7H might occur in the absence of CD80 and CD86, and so provide the minimal CD28-like signals that are required for costimulation. This would allow the clonal expansion of TH2 cells without concurrent activation of TH1 cells through CD28 co-stimulation. ICOS might also operate together with CD28 to alter the threshold of signalling. Conversely, although ICOS and CD28 enhance the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-4 and IL-10, ICOS only marginally induces IL-2 production.",12876557
TNFSF4,Co-stimulatory ligands,"OX40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and interactions between OX40 and OX40L act as costimulatory signals. We and others have extensively studied the functions of OX40 and OX40L in the immune system, including the generation of memory T cells and the stimulation of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and natural killer T cells.

CD137 is shown to be an important costimulatory molecule for T-cell activation. Engagement of CD137 on T cells by natural ligand or agonist monoclonal antibody (mAb) enhances T-cell proliferation and provides protection to CD8 T cells from activation-induced cell death through nuclear factor κB–mediated activation and up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-xL and Bfl-1. Stimulation of CD137 could also lead to activation of dendritic cells, NK cells, and macrophages in vitro.",20068221

Stimulation of CD137 could also lead to activation of dendritic cells, NK cells, and macrophages in vitro.",20068221
CCL3,Effector cell traffic,"Because it seemed likely that the protein array approach might not be sensitive enough to detect chemokines in low abundance, real-time RT-PCR was done for expression of CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10, and CCL3/MIP-lα.

CCL28,Treg and Th2 traffic,"The liver tumors may evade the host immunosurveillance and maintain the growth advantages by upregulating expression of CCL28 during hypoxia; and by binding to its receptor, CCR10, CCL28 can effectively recruit CCR10+ Treg cells to the tumor site, where this specific population of Treg cells repress the functions of effector T-cells, promoting the in vivo tumor growth.",27716621
CCR10,Treg and Th2 traffic,"The liver tumors may evade the host immunosurveillance and maintain the growth advantages by upregulating expression of CCL28 during hypoxia; and by binding to its receptor, CCR10, CCL28 can effectively recruit CCR10+ Treg cells to the tumor site, where this specific population of Treg cells repress the functions of effector T-cells, promoting the in vivo tumor growth.",27716621
CCR4,Treg and Th2 traffic,"In light of the differential expression of CCR4 on Tregs and non-Tregs and the knowledge that CCR4 is the only known receptor for CCL17 and CCL22, our data support the development of blocking antibodies or small-molecule antagonists against CCR4 that can be used in combination with other immunotherapeutic strategies in therapies for FL and other B-cell malignancies.",23686488
CCR8,Treg and Th2 traffic,"Expression of CCR8 and its ligand CCL1 is found outside the central tumor area. An impressive 5-fold increase in the expression of CCL22 (2J) and an average 45-fold increase in the number of CCL1 expressing cells (P<0.05) (2K) was observed in melanoma-affected skin, suggesting that Treg are preferentially attracted towards tumors.",27634754
AURKA,Tumor proliferation rate,"Aurora A kinase (AAK) is a member of the aurora kinase family and is expressed in all actively dividing cells. Several groups have reported increased AAK expression in aggressive lymphomas, as compared with normal B cells.",24043741
AURKB,Tumor proliferation rate,"Throughout G2, aurora B functions in a protein complex, mainly associating with microtubules near the kinetochores, and is responsible for bipolar attachment of the spindle to the centromeres and correct segregation of the daughter chromatids. Subsequently, aurora B redistributes to the midbody where it has a key role in cytokinesis. Both aurora A and B are overexpressed in a large number of human solid tumors as well as leukemia cell lines and adult AML patients, also showing a correlation with a poor prognosis in these patients.",22940834
BUB1,Tumor proliferation rate,"A far more common event in human tumors may be up-regulation of mitotic factors and several studies have found high Bub1 levels in subsets of breast and gastric cancers, and lymphomas. However, because Bub1 expression is relatively high in proliferating cells compared with quiescent or differentiated cells, increased Bub1 levels may simply represent an increase in the mitotic index of the tumors compared with neighboring tissue.",21646403
CCNB1,Tumor proliferation rate,"CCNB1 and CDC2 form a complex, which is essential for the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. This complex has a peak during the G2/M phase and must be degraded before the completion of the cell division.",15576476
CCND1,Tumor proliferation rate,"Cyclin D group includes three members, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3. Effector role in cell proliferation cascades activated by growth factor signaling is considered to be their main function, and their expression in normal cells is induced during the response to mitogenic stimuli. We found that cyclin D1 expression level is increased in several B-lymphoid neoplasms, such as MCL, BCLL, FL, and DLBCL and MZL compared with reactive cells.",20727381
CCNE1,Tumor proliferation rate,"Cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 are two important regulators of the G1-S transition modulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Our data showed a rather strong association between cyclin E expression and proliferation determined by the S-phase fraction and all lymphomas, except aggressive lymphomas, had in principle higher cyclin E index than S-phase fractions. ",9680343
CDK2,Tumor proliferation rate,"Because CDK2 regulates cell cycle progression through the interaction with both cyclin E and cyclin A2, its functions extend beyond G1 regulation to control events in S and G2/M phases. Early deregulation of the CDK2 protein in our FL samples could have great impact on the cell cycle with effects extending beyond G1, in light of the broad substrates that CDK2 and its cyclin partners affect.",16704435
CETN3,Tumor proliferation rate,"CETN3 is located at the centrosome of interphase and mitotic cells, where it plays a fundamental role in centrosome duplication.",27166259
E2F1,Tumor proliferation rate,"The E2F family of transcriptional factors modulates the expression of a broad array of genes important for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The E2F-1/DP-1 heterodimer has been shown to regulate genes involved in DNA synthesis (i.e., dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, and DNA polymerase α) and those involved in cell growth (i.e., N-myc, c-myc, IGF-1, and cyclin A).",12607600
ESCO2,Tumor proliferation rate,"Cohesin is initially loaded onto DNA in G1 by cohesin loaders (NIPBL and MAU2), but isn’t established until S-phase when SMC3 is acetylated by ESCO1 and ESCO2.",23962039
MCM2,Tumor proliferation rate,The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein family consists of six members of DNA-binding proteins. MCM proteins stand at the end of many signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation. They ensure that synthesis of DNA is initiated only once during each cell cycle. Mcm2 expression can be used to assess tumour proliferation and may be useful as an additional prognostic marker to refine the prediction of outcome in DLBCL.,16368013
MCM6,Tumor proliferation rate,Minichromosome maintenance protein 6 (MCM6) is one of six proteins of the MCM family which are involved in the initiation of DNA replication and thus represent a marker of proliferating cells.,16189522
MKI67,Tumor proliferation rate,"This protein is expressed in all cell cycle phases except G0 and may therefore be used as a proliferation marker. It was shown that the MIB-1 positive percentage of cells (so called MIB-1 labeling index (LI)) was significantly higher in Grade 3 follicular lymphoma as compared to Grades 1 and 2. Moreover, patients with a LI below the median had a significantly prolonged time to progression and improved overall survival.",22499389
MYBL2,Tumor proliferation rate,"C-myb and B-myb showed a quite different pattem of expression. They were expressed in most cell lines of all neoplastic groups, although their expression was somewhat heterogeneous within each group. These data are in agreement with previous data, suggesting that in mature lymphoid cells, c-myb and B-myb expression correlates with proliferation.",8634438
PLK1,Tumor proliferation rate,"PLK1, a mitotic regulator, important for spindle formation, is a transcriptional regulator of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. PLK1 is upregulated in cancer, including FL, and is associated with worse outcome, with interest in PLK1 as a clinical target.",23757039
CD163,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"Given the reports on polarized macrophage function and the identification of CD163 as a specific M2 macrophage marker, we investigated the prognostic value of CD163+ and CD68+ macrophage infiltrations in different tumor compartments of primary melanomas from patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I/II melanoma. Additionally, we investigated the prognostic value of sCD163 in serum from the same group of patients.",19528371
CD68,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"CD68 is a heavily glycosylated type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is mainly associated with endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Traditionally, CD68 is exploited as a valuable cytochemical marker to immunostain monocyte/macrophages in the histochemical analysis of inflamed tissues, tumor tissues, and other immunohistopathological applications. CD68 alone or in combination with other cell markers of tumor-associated macrophages showed a good predictive value as a prognostic marker of survival in cancer patients.",27869795
CSF1R,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), which is encoded by the C-FMS proto-oncogene, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and is the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1, also known as macrophage–colony-stimulating factor). CSF-1 induces TAMs to polarize toward the M2 phenotype and promote tumor progression.",24619759
IL10,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"IL10 is a Th2 product and potent inhibitor of Th1 cells. IL-10 is produced by virtually all leukocytes. In macrophages, IL-10 is elicited in response to TLR activation, glucocorticoids, and C-type lectin signaling. The macrophage transcriptome induced by IL-10 includes selected Fc receptors, the chemoattractants CXCL13 and CXCL4, and the recognition receptors formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), TLR1, TLR8, and macrophage receptor with collagenous domain (MARCO).",24669294
IL4I1,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"IL4I1 is a secreted L-amino acid oxidase that mainly catabolizes L-phenylalanine to produce hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, and phenylpyruvate. In the past 10 years, IL4I1 has been shown to be expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of numerous cancer types and to regulate T-cell properties both in vitro and in vivo.",30048651
MRC1,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"CD206, also termed as MRC1 (C-type mannose receptor 1), is an M2 macrophage marker in both the mouse and the human.",26089604
MSR1,Tumor-associated Macrophages,CD204 is the prototypic member of an expanding family of membrane receptors collectively termed scavenger receptors and a multifunctional receptor that recognizes many different types of negatively charged macromolecules. CD204-positive macrophages could be the tumor-promoting macrophages (M2 macrophages) involved in tumor progression in lung adenocarcinoma.,20802348
SIGLEC1,Tumor-associated Macrophages,"Sialoadhesin (Sn) is a macrophage-restricted lectin-like receptor with extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains that can function as a cell adhesion molecule. The membrane distal immunoglobulin-like domain binds specifically to oligosaccharides terminating in Neu5Acα2,3Gal, a glycosidic linkage that is commonly found on O- and N-linked glycans present on the surface of mammalian cells.",10610356
